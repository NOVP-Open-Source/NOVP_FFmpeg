
Steps to make installer for Splayer

Download Inno Setup (it's a freeware installer program)
http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php

(splayer1.iss was created with version 5.5.3, probably works with later versions)

makes sure that the file
npSPlayer.dll
is in the same directory as
splayer1.iss


open
splayer1.iss
in inno setup
and press the compile button (or just press Ctrl+F9)

the installer is then created and saved to Inno Setup's output folder
(in the menu use Build->Open Output Folder to find it)
